    2 T + 1/2 C dry white wine

    1/4 t salt

    5 C vegetable stock

    1/2 C diced onion

    2 C arborio rice

    1 bunch fresh spinach, rinsed stemmed and chopped

    1 C crumbled feta cheese

Instructions
---------------

In a saucepan on medium heat, saute the zucchini and garlic in 1 tablespoon of the oil for about 
5 minutes, until the zucchini are softened and most of the moisture has evaporated.

Add the dill or thyme and 2 tablespoons of wine and cook for a minute more. Add the salt and 
pepper to taste. Hold on very low heat until the risotto is ready.

In a saucepan, heat the stock to a low 
simmer.

In a soup pot on medium-high heat, saute the onions in the remaining 3 tablespoons 
of oil for about 5 minutes, until golden. 

Add the rice and stir with a wooden spoon until the grains are 
coated with oil. 

Add the 1/ 2 cup of wine and cook, stirring constantly, 
until the wine is absorbed.

Add the simmering stock l cup at a time. Cook, stirring frequently, until each cup is
absorbed before adding the next. Continue until all of the stock is used and the rice is tender 
but still al dente, about 2 to 5 minutes. 

When the rice has absorbed all of the stock, add the spinach, cover, and cook for about 2 
minutes, until the spinach is wilted but still bright green. Stir in the feta cheese.

Serve each portion of risotto topped with the 
sauteed zucchini.
