Parmesan Risotto
------------------------

Golden and elegant

Ingredients
-------------

::

    4 C vegetarian mock chicken broth (two 15-ounce cans)

    1 C water

    1 1/2 C diced onions

    1 1/2 Tablespoons butter

    1 Tablespoon olive oil

    1 1/2 to 1 teaspoon crumbled saffron threads

    1 1/2 Cups arborio or carnaroli rice

    1 1/2 Cup dry white wine

    1 1/2 Cup grated Parmesan cheese

    freshly ground black pepper to taste

Instructions
---------------

In a saucepan, bring the broth and water to a low simmer.

In another large saucepan, saute the onions in the butter and olive oil on medium-high heat until golden, about 10 minutes.

Add the saffron and rice, and stir thoroughly to coat the rice with the butter and oil.

Add the wine and cook, stirring constantly, until it is absorbed, a minute or two. Ladle in the simmering broth, 1 cup at a time, stirring the rice often.

Let the rice absorb the broth almost completely before adding more. Continue cooking until the rice is tender but al dente, about 20 minutes.

When the rice is done, remove it from the heat and stir in the grated cheese and the pepper. Serve immediately.
