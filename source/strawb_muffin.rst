Crafted gluten free.

Dry Ingredients
-------------------

::

    1 1/4 Cups rice flour

    1/4 Cup potato starch

    1/4 Cup tapioca flour

    1/2 teaspoon xanthum gum

    1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon

    1 teaspoon baking soda

    1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder

    1/2 teaspoon salt

Wet Ingredients
-----------------

::

    1/2 Cup butter, softened

    1/3 Cup sugar

    2 eggs

    1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

    1/3 Cup milk

    2 bananas, peeled

    1 1/2 Cups stemmed and coarsely

    chopped fresh strawberries



Oven
-----
350 F for 30 min in a 12-cup muffin tray

Instructions
-------------

In a large bowl, sift together the rice flour, potato starch, tapioca flour, xanthum gum, cinnamon, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Stir to mix. 

In a separate bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until smooth. Beat in the eggs and add the vanilla and milk, stirring well. The mixture will be quite lumpy.

Mash the bananas and fold them with the strawberries into the wet ingredients. Mix the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients to form a thick batter.

Spoon a generous 113 cup of batter into each muffin cup. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes. After about 15 minutes, turn the muffin tin to ensure even baking.

Insert a paring knife into a muffin; when the blade comes out clean the muffins are done. 

Place the muffin tin on a cooling rack for a few minutes, then remove the muffins from the tin and place them on the rack or a platter. Serve warm or at room temperature. Cool completely before storing in an airtight container.
