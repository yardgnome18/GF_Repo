Spice Cake
--------------------------

Ingredients
-----------

::

    1 yellow cake mix

    1 box vanilla pudding mix

    1 C water

    1/2 C water

    2 eggs

    1 T butter

    1 T vanilla

**SPICE MIX**

::

    2 T sugar

    2 T cinnamon

Oven
-----

350 F for 40 - 50 minutes

Instructions
-------------

Whisk together dry ingredients.

Whisk together wet ingredients.

Combine wet and dry ingredients to create the dough.

Grease a bundt pan, then pour in about 1/3 of the dough, layer in some of the spice mix, and repeat a second time.

Pour in the last of the dough over the second layer of spice mix -- make sure all the spice mix is covered since the sugar will burn easily if not covered.

Bake for 40 to 50 minutes until the center is firm and test toothpick comes out clean.
