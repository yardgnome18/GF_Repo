Oven
-----
350 F for 30 min in a 12-cup muffin tray

Instructions
-------------
1. If you want a topping, mix together a11 of the streusel ingredients and blend with a fork until the butter is pea-sized or smaller. Set aside.


2. In a mixing bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until smooth. Beat in the egg and then the milk and vanilla; the mixture will look lumpy.


3. In a separate large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon (if using). Mix well.


4. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and fold together with a rubber spatula without over-mixing.


5. Spoon about 1/3 cup of the batter into each muffin
cup.


6. Sprinkle each muffin with a scant tablespoon of streusel topping if you like.


7. Immediately place the muffins in the oven at 350 F and bake for 30 to 35 minutes, until puffed and golden.


8. After about 20 minutes, rotate the muffin tin in the oven to ensure even baking.


9. Remove the muffins from the oven and place the tins on a rack to cool for about 15 minutes.


10. The hot muffins are quite soft and may fall apart if handled right away. Serve warm or cool completely and store in a sealed container at room temperature.
