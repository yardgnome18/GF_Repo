Oven
----------

350 degrees, 9 x 13 baking pan for 60 minutes


Instructions
------------

Combine garlic, lime peel, lime juice, cilantro, thyme, salt, pepper, and coconut milk and whisk. Pour 1/3 into the baking pan.

Layer in 1/2 of the sweet potatoes in the bottom and top evenly with rice, half the black beans, and half the spinach.

Pour in another 1/3 of the coconut milk mix and lay down a second layer of sweet potatoes, rice, beans, and spinach.

Pour in the remaining coconut milk.  

In a small bowl combine topping ingredients and stir together, then sprinkle over the gratin.

Bake uncovered for 60 minutes, rotate after 30 minutes if needed. Let rest for 5 minutes after removing from oven.

Assemble
--------

Grease a 9x13 inch baking pan and preheat the oven to **400 degrees**.

Spread a little bit of sauce on the bottom of the pan. Layer in order: half of the tortilla strips, ALL the beans, half of the veggies, half of the sauce, half of the cheese. Cover with the other half of the tortilla strips, veggies, sauce, and cheese.

Bake
----

Bake at 400

Cover with foil (I usually spray mine with cooking spray) and bake for 15-20 minutes, until the sauce is bubbling and the cheese is melted.

Serve with guacamole, fresh cilantro, sour cream, or anything in the world that you want.
