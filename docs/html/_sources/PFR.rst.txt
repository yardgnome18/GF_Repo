:guilabel:`Power Recipe`

Ingredients
-----------

::


    1 package of Aidell's Hawaiian Sausage

    2 T sesame or peanut oil

    2 eggs, beaten

    2 cups chopped fresh pineapple

    1 large red bell pepper

    1 bunch green onions diced

    2 cloves garlic, pressed or minced

    3/4 cup chopped raw, unsalted cashews

    2 cups cooked rice

    1 - 2  T tamari (season to taste)

    1 T sriracha

    1 lime

    Fresh cilantro

Instructions
------------

Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and add 1 teaspoon oil. 

Once the pan is hot pour in the eggs and cook scrambled style. Transfer the eggs to an empty bowl.

Chop the sausage and brown in a separate skillet, reduce heat to low.

Add one tablespoon of oil to the (still hot) pan and add the pineapple and red pepper. Cook, stirring constantly, until the liquid has evaporated and the pineapple is caramelized on the edges, about 3 to 5 minutes.

Add the green onion and garlic. Cook, while stirring constantly until fragrant (estimated 30 seconds to 1 min). Transfer the contents of the pan to your bowl of eggs. 

Add the remaining two teaspoons of oil to the pan. Pour in the chopped cashew and cook, stirring constantly. Add the rice to the pan and stir to combine. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the rice is hot, about 3 minutes.

Pour the contents of the bowl back into the pan and stir to combine. Once the contents are warmed through, remove the pan from heat.

Season to taste with tamari and siracha to taste. Squeeze the juice of 1/2 of a lime over the dish and stir to combine.

Season to taste with salt. Transfer to individual serving bowls and garnish with a sprinkling of chopped cilantro leaves, with jars of chili garlic sauce or sriracha on the side.

Notes
-----

Chilled leftover rice works best, but freshly cooked is also fine.
