Instructions
-------------

Bring the eggs and water to a boil in a covered 2-quart saucepan. Reduce the heat to a rapid simmer and cook for 10 minutes.

While the eggs cook, prepare the ethnic flavorings of your choice. Submerge the cooked eggs in cold water and crack the shells to facilitate peeling.

As soon as the eggs are cool enough to handle, peel them and transfer to a large bowl. Mash the eggs well with a potato masher or fork.

Add the remaining ingredients (except the salt and pepper, if you want to add them to taste). Stir everything gently to combine and serve.
