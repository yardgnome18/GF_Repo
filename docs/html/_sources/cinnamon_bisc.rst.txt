Instructions
-------------

In a small bowl, combine the brown sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg and set aside.

In a large bowl, stir together the flour, brown sugar, baking powder, and salt. Add 1 1/2 cups of the cream and stir briskly until the dough forms a ball, about 1 minute. 

With your hands, fold the dough over a few times in the bowl, until all of the loose bits are incorporated and the dough is smooth.

Turn the dough out onto a piece of parchment paper and roll out using a second piece of parchment paper and a rolling pin; about 9 x 13 inches. 

Brush the surface of the dough with the remaining tablespoon of cream. Sprinkle evenly with the cinnamon sugar mix.

Starting from a long side, roll the dough into a cylinder. Slice into 9 equal rounds.

Place the biscuit rounds, cut side down, in an unoiled 8-inch square baking dish or a pie plate.

Bake for about 30 minutes, until the biscuits are lightly browned.

While the biscuits bake, prepare the icing. Mix together the confectioners' sugar and milk or cream until smooth. When you remove the biscuits from the oven, immediately drizzle them with the icing. Serve warm.
